**Demonstrate seamless switching:**
1. Send a global message: "Anyone can see this"
2. Switch to Private mode
3. Select recipient and send: "Only you can see this"
4. Switch back to Global mode
5. Send another global message: "Back to public chat"

**Visual confirmations:**
- Button states change (blue/red)
- Mode indicators update
- Input field visibility changes
- Message styling differs
