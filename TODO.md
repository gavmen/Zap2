# Application Improvement Roadmap

This document outlines the necessary fixes and improvements to make the chat application secure, functional, and robust. The tasks are prioritized from most critical to least critical.

---

### ✅ Phase 1: Critical Security and Functionality Fixes - COMPLETED

These issues have been addressed and the application now works as intended and is secure.

*   **✅ 1.1: Fix the Core Encryption Logic - COMPLETED**
    *   **Problem:** The application previously encrypted messages with the *sender's* public key, making it impossible for anyone else to decrypt them.
    *   **Solution Implemented:** The logic has been corrected. The sender now fetches the *recipient's* public key and uses that to encrypt the message. A complete system for key distribution has been implemented.

*   **✅ 1.2: Eliminate Critical Private Key Vulnerability - COMPLETED**
    *   **Problem:** The `EncryptionAPI` previously sent the private key to the client, where it was stored in a JavaScript variable.
    *   **Solution Implemented:** Private keys now **never** leave the client's machine.
        *   ✅ Modified `scripts.js` to generate RSA key pairs directly in the browser using the `window.crypto.subtle` API.
        *   ✅ Private keys are marked as non-exportable for maximum security.
        *   ✅ The EncryptionAPI is no longer required for key operations.

*   **✅ 1.3: Implement a Public Key Distribution System - COMPLETED**
    *   **Problem:** For a sender to encrypt a message for a recipient, they need access to that recipient's public key.
    *   **Solution Implemented:**
        *   ✅ When a client connects, they send their public key to the Go server.
        *   ✅ The Go server's `manager` stores the public key associated with each user/client.
        *   ✅ Created a `/publicKey` HTTP endpoint for clients to request the public key of another user.
        *   ✅ Implemented JSON-based WebSocket messaging for structured communication.

### ✅ Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation - COMPLETED

With the security model fixed, the core features have been built out.

*   **✅ 2.1: Implement User List and Recipient Selection - COMPLETED**
    *   **Problem:** The UI was just a broadcast chat with no way to select who to send a message to.
    *   **Solution Implemented:**
        *   ✅ Modified the Go `manager` to broadcast the list of currently connected users to all clients whenever someone joins or leaves.
        *   ✅ Updated `index.html` and `scripts.js` to display this user list in a modern interface.
        *   ✅ Users can click on a username to select them as the recipient for the next message.

*   **✅ 2.2: Implement Private Messaging - COMPLETED**
    *   **Problem:** All messages were previously broadcast to everyone.
    *   **Solution Implemented:**
        *   ✅ When a message is sent, the client includes the recipient's user ID in a JSON message.
        *   ✅ Modified the Go server to handle private messages using the `BroadcastToUser` function.
        *   ✅ Messages are now encrypted end-to-end and sent only to the intended recipient.

### ✅ Phase 2.5: Global Chat Implementation - COMPLETED

*   **✅ 2.5: Implement Global Chat Feature - COMPLETED**
    *   **Requirement:** Add global chat capability where everyone can talk by default, while maintaining private messaging.
    *   **Solution Implemented:**
        *   ✅ Created dual-mode interface with Global and Private chat modes
        *   ✅ Added mode switching buttons and visual indicators
        *   ✅ Implemented global message broadcasting to all connected users
        *   ✅ Updated server to handle both global and private message types
        *   ✅ Enhanced UI with mode-specific styling and user feedback
        *   ✅ Added click-to-chat functionality for easy private messaging
        *   ✅ Maintained all existing private messaging and encryption features

### 🔄 Phase 3: Hardening and Optimization - IN PROGRESS

These tasks will improve the quality, maintainability, and robustness of the application.

*   **⚠️ 3.1: Externalize Configuration - PARTIALLY COMPLETED**
    *   **Status:** Database connection temporarily commented out for easier testing.
    *   **Remaining Work:**
        *   Use environment variables or a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) to manage the database DSN.
        *   Make the server port configurable.

*   **✅ 3.2: Refactor `EncryptionAPI` - COMPLETED**
    *   **Status:** The C# API is no longer needed.
    *   **Solution:** All encryption/decryption is now handled client-side via `window.crypto.subtle`. The EncryptionAPI has been deprecated.

*   **🔜 3.3: Add Basic User Authentication - PLANNED**
    *   **Problem:** Any user can still claim any username.
    *   **Solution:** Implement a simple session-based authentication or a token system to ensure user identity.

*   **🔄 3.4: Clean Up Code - IN PROGRESS**
    *   **Problem:** The code contains extensive `console.log` and `fmt.Println` statements for debugging.
    *   **Status:** Some cleanup done, more structured logging needed.

### 🆕 Phase 4: Additional Features and Improvements

*   **🔜 4.1: Message Persistence**
    *   **Goal:** Re-enable database integration for chat history storage.
    *   **Requirements:** MySQL setup and configuration.

*   **🔜 4.2: Mobile Responsiveness**
    *   **Goal:** Optimize the UI for mobile devices.
    *   **Requirements:** Responsive CSS and touch-friendly interface.

*   **🔜 4.3: Advanced Security Features**
    *   **Goal:** Implement Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) and message authenticity verification.
    *   **Requirements:** Enhanced cryptographic protocols.

*   **🔜 4.4: Group Chat**
    *   **Goal:** Support encrypted group conversations.
    *   **Requirements:** Multi-recipient encryption and group management.

*   **🔜 4.5: File Sharing**
    *   **Goal:** Encrypted file transfer capability.
    *   **Requirements:** Binary data handling and progress indicators.

3. **Run main application**: http://localhost:8080
4. **Test Global Chat**:
   - Open multiple browser tabs with different usernames
   - Use default Global mode to send messages visible to everyone
   - Verify real-time delivery to all users
5. **Test Private Chat**:
   - Switch to Private mode or click on a username
   - Send encrypted messages between specific users
   - Verify messages are only visible to sender and recipient
6. **Test Mode Switching**:
   - Switch between Global and Private modes
   - Verify UI updates and functionality in each mode
